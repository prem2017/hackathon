Agriculture is a field that is very much affected by climatic events: **heat**, **cold**, **frost**, **rain**, **hail**, **wind**.

## These events will

1. Impact crops by causing crop losses, damage to fruits, sometimes for several years (impact of hail on vines, can be felt the following year, with fewer buds)
2. Impact farming operations: the wind limits the possibilities of treatment, rain can make the soil impassable for agricultural machinery.
